# Advent of Code Solutions

All of my advent of code solutions in one place. I realised that having a tonne of them as git repositories in my account would basically be academic yapping.

## Advent of Code 2023 in Perl

I'm using AOC this year to learn perl. All solutions take in the
puzzle input on standard input. Run by executing:

```
perl X.pl < INPUT
```

Everything has been tested on perl 5.38.

2021 solutions can be found [here](https://github.com/nassir90/adventofcode).
