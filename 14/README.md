I wanted to refine my brute force solution to work for part 2 but it
took me longer than it would have taken me to make my optimal
solution. That said, the main trick here was recognising the cycle,
which happened after only 84 cycles in my case. It would actually be a
better approach to keep the brute force logic and focus on cycle
recognition as the brute force approach probably won't take an
unreasonable amount of time to complete.
